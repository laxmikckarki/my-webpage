# my-webpage
this is my simple webpage about the e-commerce. where user can buy the different flowers and As a user, theycan comment in an input box so that it can be submitted and read by the intended audience.
- As a user they can click a 'submit' button so that their comment in the input box can be posted below in a 'comments section'
## Debugging
As with my commenting project I had issues with CSS inheritance overriding my styles on the Code Blocks project building page. I used the knowledge I gained doing my commenting project and applied the same techniques here.
